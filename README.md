## Overview

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) is a great place to practice frontend skills by building real world small components that are readily used in modern websites.

This repository contains all of my projects that I made for practicing my basic HTML, CSS and JS through the projects that are currently listed in their "newbie" section.

## Background

For the past 4 months, I have been learning the fundamentals of web-development by learning HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and React.JS. I have been practicing building single-page website on my own, sometimes by viewing some Figma designs on Pinterest or by following some YouTube tutorial. But I always felt that, that practice was not structured.

Hence, after researching, I found this website where I could practice in a structured manner.

This repo contains most/all of the current projects that are listed in the Frontend Mentor's "newbie" level.

## All Projects

All of the projects are listed down below. Though they are in no particular order, I have tried to follow the default "next" suggestion from the website once a project is completed.

Each project contains its own index.html, style.css, script.js(if needed), assets/images, ss, README.md (which explains everything about that particular project). Other files/folder may also exist depending upon the project.

### Structure

Each project is described below in the following structure:

- Project number
- Name and the brief of the what was made.
- Screenshot of the final result
